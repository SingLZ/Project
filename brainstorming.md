Top 2

1. Hangry Joe App
**Mobile:** Having a Mobile version will enchance user experiences because customers would be able to recieve real time notification on when their order is ready. There can also be maps to show user closest store location. 
**Story:** I am currently working at Hangry as a part-time and many customers ask if we have an app or some sort that they can keep track of their order or earn points etc. I think if there is something like that it would make ordering easier.
**Market:** This app have a pretty large market since anyone can order food online. Hangry Joe is a fried chicken restuarant so anyone who is interest could possibly be the audience,
**Habit:** Users would only comsume from this app since its main purpose is to take orders. It could develope habits for user if they order from here often, but it is not addictive in a way that a person would open this app everyday. 
**Scope:** It is challenging to complete the app within a short amount of time, but I think basic features can be implemented without much complication.

2. Plant Tracking App
**Mobile:** I think this app is useful in mobile version because it can sned real time reminders to water plants and allow user to keep track of plant growth. 
**Story:** I peronally have many plants at home, but often time I forget when is the last time that I water them so they can suffer from dyharation. Especially during weeks where I am really busy with school work I forget to water them.
**Market:** This app have aims towards plant lovers who don't have time to keep track of water dates and amount so this app serves as an reminder. 
**Habit:** Users would only comsume from this app since its main purpose is send reminders. I do not think there will be any addicting features becasue the main purpose is to serve as reminders.
**Scope:** I think the scope of this application is rather simple and the main functionally would be to calculation time. It has a high chance of being completed within the time range.
